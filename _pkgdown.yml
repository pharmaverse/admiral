  desc: |
    As `{admiral}` is still evolving, functions/arguments may need to be removed or replaced over time. In such cases, the function/argument will enter the following 6-month deprecation cycle:

    * In the first release (0-3 months), there will be a warning issued if you use the function/argument, but it will still be available to use.
    * In the following release (3-6 months), an error will be produced if you use the function/argument.
    * Finally, from the 3rd release (6 months) onwards, the function/argument will be removed from `{admiral}` and its documentation completely.

    *Note: Guidance on replacement functionality can be found in the warning/error message produced or in the function's documentation.*

    Below, you can find a list of functions in the process of being deprecated:

\usage{
convert_dtc_to_dt(
  dtc,
  highest_imputation = "n",
  date_imputation = "first",
  min_dates = NULL,
  max_dates = NULL,
  preserve = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dtc}{The --DTC date to convert.

\describe{
\item{Default value}{none}
}}

\item{highest_imputation}{Highest imputation level

The \code{highest_imputation} argument controls which components of the DTC
value are imputed if they are missing. All components up to the specified
level are imputed.

If a component at a higher level than the highest imputation level is
missing, \code{NA_character_} is returned. For example, for \code{highest_imputation = "D"} \code{"2020"} results in \code{NA_character_} because the month is missing.

If \code{"n"} is specified no imputation is performed, i.e., if any component is
missing, \code{NA_character_} is returned.

If \code{"Y"} is specified, \code{date_imputation} should be \code{"first"} or \code{"last"}
and \code{min_dates} or \code{max_dates} should be specified respectively. Otherwise,
\code{NA_character_} is returned if the year component is missing.

\describe{
\item{Permitted values}{\code{"Y"} (year, highest level), \code{"M"} (month), \code{"D"}
(day), \code{"n"} (none, lowest level)}
\item{Default value}{\code{"n"}}
}}

\item{date_imputation}{The value to impute the day/month when a datepart is
missing.

A character value is expected, either as a
\itemize{
\item format with month and day specified as \code{"mm-dd"}: e.g. \code{"06-15"} for the
15th of June (The year can not be specified; for imputing the year
\code{"first"} or \code{"last"} together with \code{min_dates} or \code{max_dates} argument can
be used (see examples).),
\item or as a keyword: \code{"first"}, \code{"mid"}, \code{"last"} to impute to the first/mid/last
day/month. If \code{"mid"} is specified, missing components are imputed as the
middle of the possible range:
\itemize{
\item If both month and day are missing, they are imputed as \code{"06-30"}
(middle of the year).
\item If only day is missing, it is imputed as \code{"15"} (middle of the month).
}
}

The argument is ignored if \code{highest_imputation} is less then \code{"D"}.

\describe{
\item{Default value}{\code{"first"}}
}}

\item{min_dates}{Minimum dates

A list of dates is expected. It is ensured that the imputed date is not
before any of the specified dates, e.g., that the imputed adverse event start
date is not before the first treatment date. Only dates which are in the
range of possible dates of the \code{dtc} value are considered. The possible dates
are defined by the missing parts of the \code{dtc} date (see example below). This
ensures that the non-missing parts of the \code{dtc} date are not changed.
A date or date-time object is expected.
For example

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{impute_dtc_dtm(
  "2020-11",
  min_dates = list(
   ymd_hms("2020-12-06T12:12:12"),
   ymd_hms("2020-11-11T11:11:11")
  ),
  highest_imputation = "M"
)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

returns \code{"2020-11-11T11:11:11"} because the possible dates for \code{"2020-11"}
range from \code{"2020-11-01T00:00:00"} to \code{"2020-11-30T23:59:59"}. Therefore
\code{"2020-12-06T12:12:12"} is ignored. Returning \code{"2020-12-06T12:12:12"} would
have changed the month although it is not missing (in the \code{dtc} date).

\describe{
\item{Default value}{\code{NULL}}
}}

\item{max_dates}{Maximum dates

A list of dates is expected. It is ensured that the imputed date is not after
any of the specified dates, e.g., that the imputed date is not after the data
cut off date. Only dates which are in the range of possible dates are
considered. A date or date-time object is expected.

\describe{
\item{Default value}{\code{NULL}}
}}

\item{preserve}{Preserve day if month is missing and day is present

For example \code{"2019---07"} would return \verb{"2019-06-07} if \code{preserve = TRUE}
(and \code{date_imputation = "MID"}).

\describe{
\item{Permitted values}{\code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE}}
\item{Default value}{\code{FALSE}}
}}

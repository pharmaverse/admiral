# Contribution to {admiral} 

This outlines how to propose a change to admiral. For more detailed info about contributing to admiral, and other pharmaverse packages, please see the [development process guide](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/development_process.html) as well as other Developer Guides in the Articles section of the [{admiral} website](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/index.html)

# Basics
 * For each new contribution, the user creates an issue on the issue tab on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/issues) to put it in our backlog. The issues can range from bug identification and/or fixes, enhancements to functions, documentation, tests or new features.   

 * We advise you to contact us when an [issue](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/issues) is created via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269) (If you don't have access, use this [link](https://join.slack.com/t/pharmaverse/shared_invite/zt-yv5atkr4-Np2ytJ6W_QKz_4Olo7Jo9A) to join).  We can discuss details or align expectations if you are not familiar with the `{admiral}` philosophy and programming strategy. The team will try to review the issues within the next backlog meeting and give some initial feedback. Since we are not a 100% fully resourced software development team it might be that some issues will take longer to respond to depending on the amount of overall issues. 

 * Familiarize yourself with our [programming strategy](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/programming_strategy.html), guidance for [GitHub Usage](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/git_usage.html) and [unit testing](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/unit_test_guidance.html)

 * All [created issues](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/issues) will be reviewed within the next backlog meeting and the creator will receive an initial feedback via a comment. Someone from the core development team will then triage new issues by assigning the appropriate labels (such as “user request” so we can easily identify new requests).
 
 * Issues are meant to be taken on by users from the Pharma programming community and not exclusively by the `{admiral}` team from GSK and Roche.

# Contribution Model


Type 1 Contribution with Code: 

 * First, the user creates an issue or comments on an existing issue to notify that they’d like to contribute code.
 
 * Follow our development process step-by-step guide.
 
 * We advise to contact an `{admiral}` core development team directly via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269) before submitting code for complex functionality.


Type 2 Contribution without Code: 

 * User creates an issue and ideally contacts an `{admiral}` team member via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269).
 
 * The `{admiral}` core development team will contact the issue creator as soon as possible to discuss further details.

#### What does **generalized functions & facilitate** mean?

Functions are usually not necessarily specific but parameter driven: 

* e.g. the `derive_aage` has a parameterized start and end-date and a unit. 
* Depending on the parameters results may vary as does the specification.

#### How does a user **know what a function does** exactly?

* Function details and its purpose, the requirements, parameters, dependencies and examples are documented in the header of each function.
* Complex functions potentially have an own vignette (wiki page) on the admiral homepage (date imputation). 
* admiral does not provide a link to an explicit specification in the define.xml.

#### Would admiral **create a whole** ADaM  dataset?

* No, users will use the functions from the admiral package to create their ADaM dataset.

#### In **which order** does a user need to execute the functions?

* Guidance will be provided for ADSL, BDS and OCCDS ADaM structure including template scripts.

#### Is the admiral  package **validated**?

* All functions  are reviewed and tested to ensure that  they  work as described in the documentation. 
* Test  cases for each function  will  be part of the R package.
* The  testing the  admiral team will do for each functions does **not to replace the QC and validation  process at each company**.
* Users can add to the  tests or provide additional feedback.

#### Will **admiral provide harmonized define.xml** or submittable specifications for functions?

* No. The functions  are documented  via programming  headers, the define.xml  is the responsibility  of the end user.
* Functions  are usually  generalized  and not specific. (see [What does **generalized functions & facilitate** mean?])

#### Will admiral provide ADaM IG **CDISC compliant** datasets?

* Although admiral follows CDISC standards it does not claim that the dataset resulting from calling admiral functions is ADaM compliant. This has to be ensured by the user.

#### How much of the **ADaM IG is covered  by admiral? Proposal**:

* ADaM  IG is a standard framework without a specific No of datasets or variables, so it cannot be used as a specific baseline to answer that question.
* We will provide guidance for each ADaM  dataset structure (ADSL, OCCDS and BDS) that will highlight which functionality admiral covers. (see [In **which order** does a user need to execute the functions?])
* The guidance will also highlight the gaps to be filled by the user (e.g. timing, ranges).
* For standard ADaM datasets (ADAE, ADCM ...) we can provide an estimated coverage.

#### Will there be a user/**contribution** guide?

* All admiral information can be found on the [github webpage](https://roche-gsk.github.io/admiral/articles/admiral.html).
* Our programming strategy serves as a [contribution guide](https://roche-gsk.github.io/admiral/articles/contributing.html).
* How users can contribute technically is TBD.

#Introduction 

This vignette gives you an overview of the anticipated contribution model.
The goal is to enable users of admiral to contribute and test the contribution model for admiral. Adjustments might be done over time.
 
Our contribution model is still in a testing phase so we advise you to contact us via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02C8UN2JTT) when an issue is created to discuss details or align expectations if you are not familiar with the admiral philosophy and programming strategy. The team will try to review the issues within the next sprint and give some initial feedback. Since we are not a 100% fully resourced software development team it might be that some issues will take longer to respond to depending on the amount of overall issues. 


# Basics
 * For each new contribution, the user or Data Scientist creates an issue on the issue tab on [Git](https://github.com/Roche-GSK/admiral/issues) and put it in our backlog.
 
 * Label each issue with a label named “user request” so we can easily identify new requests.
 
 * Familiarize yourself with our [programming strategy](programming_strategy.html), guidance for [github usage](git_usage.html) and unit testing and the overall [goal of admiral](https://roche-gsk.github.io/admiral/index.html).
 
 * All created issues will be reviewed within the next sprint and the creator will receive an initial feedback via a comment.
 
 * Issues are meant to be taken on by users and Data Scientists from the pharma programming community and not exclusively by the admiral team from GSK and Roche.

# Contribution Model

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='120%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./admiral_contribution_model.png')
```

Type 1 Contribution with Code: 

 * First, the user creates an issue or comments on an existing issue to notify that they’d like to contribute code.
 
 * User creates a new branch within the development branch (devel) and creates a [pull request](https://roche-gsk.github.io/admiral/articles/pr_review_guidance.html) for review [github usage](git_usage.html).

 * Code should follow our [programming strategy](programming_strategy.html).
 
 * We advise to contact an admiral core development team directly via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02C8UN2JTT) before submitting code for complex functionality. 


Type 2 Contribution without Code: 

 * User creates an issue and ideally contacts an admiral team member via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02C8UN2JTT). 
 
 * The admiral core development team will contact the issue creator as soon as possible to discuss further details.

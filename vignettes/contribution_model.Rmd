# Introduction

This vignette gives you an overview on how you can contribute to
`{admiral}`. We try to align to best practices used in other R packages'
development processes - so veteran developers should be familiar with
our processes. However, we do deviate slightly from some best practices
and we advise all new contributors to review our contribution model.

We advise you to contact us when an issue is created via
[Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269) *(If you
don't have access, use this
[link](https://join.slack.com/t/pharmaverse/shared_invite/zt-yv5atkr4-Np2ytJ6W_QKz_4Olo7Jo9A)
to join)*. We can discuss details or align expectations if you are not
familiar with the `{admiral}` philosophy and programming strategy. The
team will review the issues and give some initial feedback. Since we are
not a 100% fully resourced software development team it might be that
some issues will take longer to respond to depending on the amount of
overall issues.

Check out our YouTube video for [contributor
onboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcDxBmlpykw&t=6s), where we
use a dummy issue in the demo to illustrate our development process.

# Basics

🦋 For each new contribution, the user creates an issue on the issue tab
on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/issues) to put it in
our backlog.

🦋 Familiarize yourself with our [programming
strategy](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/devel/articles/programming_strategy.html),
guidance for [GitHub
usage](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/devel/articles/git_usage.html)
and [unit
testing](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/devel/articles/unit_test_guidance.html).

🦋 All [created issues](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/issues)
will be reviewed and the creator will receive an initial feedback via a
comment. Someone from the core development team will then triage new
issues by assigning the appropriate labels (such as "user request" so we
can easily identify new requests).

🦋 Issues are meant to be taken on by users from the Pharma programming
community and not exclusively by the `{admiral}` team from GSK and
Roche.

# Contribution Model

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='120%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./admiral_contribution_model.png")
```

⭐ Type 1 Contribution without Code:

💬 User creates an issue and ideally contacts an `{admiral}` team member
via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269).

💬 The `{admiral}` core development team will contact the issue creator
as soon as possible to discuss further details.

⭐ Type 2 Contribution with Code:

🕐 User creates an issue or comments on an existing issue to notify that
they'd like to contribute code.

🕑 We advise to contact the `{admiral}` core development team directly
via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269) before
submitting code for complex functionality.

🕒 Once an issue is assigned to you by admiral core development team,
follow our step-by-step guide in the development process section below,
or checkout the [admiral contributor onboarding YouTube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcDxBmlpykw&t=6s).

## Development Process

If you decide to contribute with code and you're ready to make your
first code contribution, this development process step-by-step guide
will help tie all the other detailed vignettes together to give you the
simplest experience of helping to grow and enhance our codebase.

1.  Create a new feature branch from the development branch `main`
    following the naming convention and pull the latest changes - as
    detailed on the [GitHub
    usage](git_usage.html#working-with-feature-branches-1) guide.
2.  Familiarize yourself with the `{admiral}` [programming
    strategy](programming_strategy.html), and then make the required
    code updates.
3.  Before making a pull request, check the [Pull Request Review
    Guidance](pr_review_guidance.html) & the following checklist of
    common things developers miss:
    a.  Is all your code formatted according to the
        [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) style guide?
    b.  Did you create/add appropriate [unit
        tests](unit_test_guidance.html#writing-unit-tests-in-admiral)?
    c.  If you removed/replaced any function and/or function parameters,
        did you fully follow the [deprecation
        guidance](programming_strategy.html#deprecation)?
    d.  Did you update the
        [documentation](programming_strategy.html#function-header-documentation)?
        If so, remember to run `devtools::document()` and include the
        updated `NAMESPACE` and `.Rd` files in `man/`
    e.  Does your code update have any impact on the [ADaM
        template](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/cran-release/articles/admiral.html#starting-a-script)
        R scripts stored in `inst/templates`?
    f.  Does your code update have any impact on the vignettes stored in
        vignettes?
    g.  Did you update the Changelog `NEWS.md`?
    h.  Did you build `{admiral}` site `pkgdown::build_site()` and check
        that all affected examples are displayed correctly and that all
        new functions occur on the
        "[Reference](../reference/index.html)" page?
4.  Once happy with all the updates, make a [pull
    request](git_usage.html#pull-request) to merge to the `main` branch
    and link the issue so that it closes after successful merging.
5.  Check that there are no merge conflicts. If there are any, fix them
    before requesting review. See [solving merge
    conflicts](git_usage.html#solving-merge-conflicts-in-the-terminal-on-rstudio)
    guidance.
6.  Check the results of the automated `R-CMD check` and `lintr` checks
    and if any issues consult this
    [guide](pr_review_guidance.html#common-r-cmd-check-issues).
7.  Assign a reviewer from the `{admiral}` core development team -- this
    could be anyone you discussed the issue with previously via Slack or
    GitHub. If unsure, add a comment that the pull request is ready for
    review and add the `@pharmaverse/admiral` tag to it.
8.  Once the review is completed, the reviewer will merge the PR and
    this will then automatically delete the feature branch.

*Finally, just a note to say from the core developers that we hugely
appreciate you taking the time to contribute to `{admiral}`. Don't be
offended if during review we send requests back to you, as the
expectations are high so that we can ensure the `{admiral}` codebase
remains robust and consistent. The best way to learn here is always to
jump in and get involved, so please don't be afraid you'll make mistakes
along the way -- we all have and continue to do so, and that's what the
reviews are for. Also if ever you get stuck don't hesitate to reach out
for support via the [Slack
channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269).
**Welcome to our `{admiral}` community!***

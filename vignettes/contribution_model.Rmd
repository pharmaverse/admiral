# Introduction 

This vignette gives you an overview of the anticipated contribution model.
The goal is to enable users of `{admiral}` to contribute and test the contribution model for `{admiral}`. Adjustments might be made over time.
 
Our contribution model is still in a testing phase so we advise you to contact us when an issue is created via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269) _(If you don't have access, use this [link](https://join.slack.com/t/pharmaverse/shared_invite/zt-yv5atkr4-Np2ytJ6W_QKz_4Olo7Jo9A) to join)_.  We can discuss details or align expectations if you are not familiar with the `{admiral}` philosophy and programming strategy. The team will try to review the issues within the next sprint and give some initial feedback. Since we are not a 100% fully resourced software development team it might be that some issues will take longer to respond to depending on the amount of overall issues. 

# Basics
 * For each new contribution, the user creates an issue on the issue tab on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/issues) to put it in our backlog. 
 
 * Familiarize yourself with our [programming
 strategy](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/main/articles/programming_strategy.html),
 guidance for [GitHub
 usage](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/main/articles/git_usage.html)
 and [unit
 testing](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/main/articles/unit_test_guidance.html).

 * All [created issues](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/issues) will be reviewed within the next sprint and the creator will receive an initial feedback via a comment. Someone from the core development team will then triage new issues by assigning the appropriate labels (such as “user request” so we can easily identify new requests).
 
 * Issues are meant to be taken on by users from the Pharma programming
 community and not exclusively by the `{admiral}` team from GSK and Roche.

# Contribution Model

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='120%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./admiral_contribution_model.png")
```

Type 1 Contribution with Code: 

 * First, the user creates an issue or comments on an existing issue to notify that they’d like to contribute code.
 
 * Follow our [development
 process](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/devel/articles/development_process.html)
 step-by-step guide.
 
 * We advise to contact an `{admiral}` core development team directly via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269) before submitting code for complex functionality.


Type 2 Contribution without Code: 

 * User creates an issue and ideally contacts an `{admiral}` team member via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269).
 
 * The `{admiral}` core development team will contact the issue creator as soon as possible to discuss further details.

# Introduction

This article will give you an overview of how the `{admiral}` project is utilizing the version-control software `git` and the website GitHub while working with RStudio. We will go over the primary branches that house the source code for the `{admiral}` project as well as how we use **Feature** branches to address **Issues**.  Issues can range from bugs to enhancement that have been identified or requested by developers, users or testers. We also provide the bare minimum of `git` commands needed to get up and running. Please refer to the [Resource](#github_resources) section for more in-depth guidance on using `git` and GitHub. Finally, we discuss the release process and schedule for `{admiral}`.

# Branches

-	The `main` branch contains the latest **released** version and should not be used for development. You can find the released versions [here](https://GitHub.com/pharmaverse/admiral/releases) 
-	The `devel` branch contains the latest development version of the package. You will mostly likely be branching off and pulling into the `devel` branch.
- The `gh-pages` branches contains the code used to render this website you are looking at right now!
- The `main`, `devel` and `gh-pages` branches are under protection. If you try and push changes to these branches you will get an error unless you are an administrator. 

-	**Feature** branches are where actual development related to a specific issue happens. Feature branches are merged into `devel` once a pull request is merged. Check out the [Pull Request Review Guidance](pr_review_guidance.html).


# Working with Feature Branches

Feature Branches are where most developers will work when addressing Issues. 

## Implementing an Issue

Each feature branch must be related to an issue.

**Name:**  
The name of the branch must be prefixed with the issue number and be meaningful, e.g. issue #94 "Program function to derive `LSTALVDT`", the Branch name would be: `94_lstalvdt`.

### Create a New Feature Branch from the Terminal (from `devel`)

-	Checkout the devel branch: `git checkout devel`  
-	Pull the latest changes from GitHub: `git pull`  
-	Create a new branch off the devel branch and switch to it: `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`

### Create a New Feature Branch from GitHub (from `devel`)

You can also create a feature branch in GitHub. 

- Switch to the `devel` branch
- Type in your new feature branch name
- Click Create branch: `<your_branch_name>` from `devel`
- Be Sure to Pull down newly created branch into RStudio

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("github_feature_branch.png", dpi = 144)
```


### Commits from the Terminal in RStudio

To start the commit process, you will need to tell `git` to move your changes to the staging area.  Use `git add <your_file>` to move all changes of `<your_file>` in the staging area to wait for the next commit. You can use `git add .` to move all files you have worked on to the staging area.  Next you can commit, which takes a snapshot of your staged changes.  When committing, prefix the message with the issue number and add a meaningful message `git commit –m '#94 last alive date implementation'`. 

Lastly, you should push your changes up to GitHub using `git push origin <branch name>`

### Commits from the Git Tab in RStudio

You can also make use of the Git Tab within RStudio to commit your changes. A benefit of using this Tab is being able to see your changes to the file with red and green highlighting. Just like in the terminal, start the message with the issue number and add a meaningful and succinct sentence.  Hit the Commit button and then Push up to GitHub.  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("github_committ.png", dpi = 144)
```


**NOTE:**  Placing the issue number in your commit message allows new developers to quickly find discussion surrounding your issue. When pushed to GitHub the issue number will hyperlink to the issue tracker. A powerful tool for discussion.

## Pull request

We recommend a thorough read through of the articles, [Pull Request Review Guidance](pr_review_guidance.html) and the [Programming Strategy](programming_strategy.html) for in-depth discussions on a doing a proper Pull Request.  Pull Request authors will benefit from shorter review times by closely following the guidance provided in those two articles. Below we discuss some simple `git` commands in the terminal and on GitHub for doing a Pull Request. We recommend doing the Pull Request in GitHub only and not through the terminal.  

Once all changes are committed, push the updated branch to GitHub:  
`git push -u origin <branch_name>`  
  
In GitHub, under **Pull requests**, the user will either have a "Compare and pull request" button and/or a "Create Pull Request".  The first button will be created for you if GitHub detects recent changes you have made. The branch to merge with must be the `devel` branch (base = `devel`) and the compare branch is the new branch to merge - as shown in the below picture. Please **pay close attention** to the branch you are merging into!  

The issue must be linked to the pull request in the "Development" field of the
Pull Request.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("github_linked_issues_dark.png", dpi = 144)
```

Once you have completed the Pull Request you will see all committed changes are then available for the reviewer.  A reviewer must be specified in the Pull Request. It is recommended to write a brief summary to your reviewers so they can quickly come up to speed on your Pull Request.  Pictures are nice too, which are easy to do in GitHub!  Use any Screen Capture software and Copy and Paste into your summary. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("github_create_pr.png", dpi = 144)
```

### Reviewing/Closing an Issue

- At least one reviewer must approve the Pull Request. Please review the [Pull
Request Review Guidance](pr_review_guidance.html), which provides in depth
guidance on doing a proper Pull Request.
- The reviewer must ensure that the function follows the programming strategy
recommendations.
- Any comment/question/discussion must be addressed and documented in GitHub
before the Pull Request is merged

Once the review is completed, the reviewer will merge the Pull Request and the
feature branch will automatically be deleted.

After merging the Pull Request the corresponding issue must be moved to the
"Done" column on the "admiral core board" by the developer. **The issue
must not be closed**. It will be closed automatically once the `devel` branch is
merged into the `main` branch.

```

### Solving Merge Conflicts in the Terminal on RStudio

Merge conflict is a situation where `git` cannot decide which changes to apply since there were multiple updates in the same part of a file. This typically happens when multiple people update the same part of code. Those conflicts always need to be handled manually (as some further code updates may be required):

```
git checkout devel
git pull
git checkout <feature_branch>  
git merge devel
```
  
This provides a list of all files with conflicts In the file with conflicts the conflicting sections are marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`. The code between these markers must be updated and the markers be removed. Source files need to be updated manually. Generated files like NAMESPACE or the generated documentation files should not be updated manually but recreated after the source files were updated. 
  
To make the changes available call:

```
git add <file with conflict> 
git commit -m "<insert_message>"
git push
```

### Solving Merge Conflicts in GitHub

For simple merge conflicts, developers can make use of the GitHub interface to solve them. GitHub will show the number of conflicts between the two branches. In the below image, GitHub has found 3 conflicts, but we only display the first one.  Just like in the terminal, GitHub will make use of the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` to highlight the conflicting sections.  You will need to make the decision on whether to keep the code from the base or the feature branch.  Once you have decided, go into the code and remove the section you no longer wish to keep.  Be sure to remove the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` as well!  Once you work through the conflicts you will mark as **Resolved and Commit your changes**.  It is recommended to pull your branch back down to RStudio to make sure no untoward effects have happen to your branch. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("github_conflicts.png", dpi = 144)
```


## Useful `git` Commands

-	merging: `git merge <my_branch>` - merge my_branch into current branch  
-	The stashing commands are useful when one wants to go back to clean directory 
-	`git stash` - stash (store) current changes and restore a clean directory  
-	`git stash pop` - put back (restore) stashed changes  
- `git revert` is also helpful but why?

**Using code from unmerged branches**  

-	Checkout the unmerged branch you want to use: `git checkout <unmerged_branch>`  
-	Pull the latest committed changes from the unmerged branch: `git pull`  
-	Check out your feature branch: `git checkout <my_branch>`  
-	Merge the unmerged branch to <my_branch>: `git merge <unmerged_branch>`

# Package Release

## Quarterly Release

A package release is done in four parts:

1) Declare a freeze on all Pull Requests going into the `devel` branch via internal channels.
1) Create a PR from `devel` into the `pre-release` branch.  Verify that all CI/CD checks are passing and bundle up and send off to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
1) Once package is available on CRAN, another Pull Request is created for merging the `pre-release` branch the `main` branch.  This will trigger the action to rebuild the `{admiral}` website with all the updates for this release.
1) Use the release button on GitHub to "release" the package onto GitHub.  This release onto Github archives the version of code within the `main` branch, attaches the News/Changelog file, bundles the code into a `tar.gz` file and makes a validation report via the GitHub action `validation` from [insightsengineering/validatoR](https://github.com/insightsengineering/thevalidatoR).  Please see past [admiral releases](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/releases) for reference. 

**Quarterly Release:**  `devel >> pre-release >> main` 

## Hot Fix Release

Occasionally we will need to release a hot fix to address a package breaking bug.  A hot fix release is done in 6 parts:

1) Create two branches called `patch` and `pre-release` off the current `main`.
1) Pull Requests that address the bugs should be merged into the `patch` branch.
1) Create a PR from `patch` into a newly created `pre-release` branch off of `main`.  Verify that all CI/CD checks are passing and bundle up and send off to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
1) Once package is approved and available on CRAN, another PR is created for merging the `pre-release` branch into the `main` branch.  This will trigger the action to rebuild the `{admiral}` website with all the updates for this hot fix release.
1) Use the release button on GitHub to "release" the package onto GitHub.  This release onto Github archives the version of code within the `main` branch, attaches the News/Changelog file, bundles the code into a `tar.gz` file and makes a validation report via the GitHub action `validation` from [insightsengineering/validatoR](https://github.com/insightsengineering/thevalidatoR).  Please see past [admiral releases](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/releases) for reference.
1) These hot fixes should then be merged into the `devel` branch through an additional PR.  

**Hot Fix Release**: `patch >> pre-release >> main  >> devel`

##  Release Schedule

We have decided to release `{admiral}` on a quarterly schedule to ensure downstream and upstream packages can adequately planned their time for updates and releases.  

`{admiral}` releases are targeted for the first Monday of the last month of each quarter.  Pull Requests will be frozen the week before a release. 
The `admiral` family has several downstream and upstream dependencies and so this release shall be done in three Phases:  

* Phase 1 release is for `{admiraldev}` and `{admiral.test}`, which feed into all `admiral` packages
* Phase 2 release is only for core `{admiral}`
* Phase 3 release is extension packages, e.g. `{admiralonco}`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


## Purpose

Functions and Tools for developing core `{admiral}` functions.  Most functions in `{admiraldev}` are around testing inputs going into `{admiral}` functions. There are also  additional quality of life functions/Addins to assist developers of `{admiral}` or `{admiral}` extension packages as well as functions to help with rendering documentation.  

**NOTE:** This package is not intended for standalone use but rather as a central dependency for `{admiral}` and its extension packages 

## Installation

The package is available from CRAN and can be installed by running `install.packages("admiraldev")`.

To install the latest development version of the package directly from GitHub use the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

remotes::install_github("pharmaverse/admiraldev", ref = "devel")
```

## Release Schedule

`{admiraldev}` is to be officially released to CRAN one week before an official release of `{admiral}`.  You can find the release schedule for `{admiral}` packages [here](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/#release-schedule).

#' Environment Objects
#'
#' @details
#' Once in a while, we may encounter "locked binding for 'xxx'." errors
#' during the development process while building out functions. This may arise because
#' we want to create dynamic data/objects based on user-inputs that need modification
#' at points in time after the package has been loaded. To manage such data or objects,
#' R has a data structure known as an 'environment'. These environment objects are created
#' at build time, but can be populated with values after the package has been loaded and
#' update those values over the course of an R session. For more details how environments work,
#' see relevant sections on environments in R Packages and Advanced R textbooks for more details.

# To enhance features and add inputs as necessary

# 1. Add additional options such as future_input as shown in comment above
# 2. Update @params with future_input in set_admiral_options roxygen documentation
# 3. Add future_input into set_admiral_options() formals and body
